# preview-course-files-on-university-site

TO-DO LIST: 

> Instead of preview buttons displaying for incompatible .doc/.ppt/.xls and prompting conversion into appropriate .docx/.pptx/.xlsx formats, next update will likely only show the icons for the compatible formats.

> Pdf - download function currently saves file as document.pdf (make it save under actual document name)

> Pptx - invert color 70% might help with fixing color on morphology course ppts.
